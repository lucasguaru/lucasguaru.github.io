    title: 'Island in the Sun',
    artist: 'Weezer',
    lyrics: `When you're on a holiday
You can't find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I wanna feel it too
On an island in the sun
We'll be playin' and havin' fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

When you're on a golden sea
You don't need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone
On an island in the sun
We'll be playin' and havin' fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore

On an island in the sun
We'll be playin' and havin' fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can't control my brain

We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore
No, no
No, no
No, no
No, no
No, no
We'll never feel bad anymore
No, no
No, no
No, no
No, no
No, no
We'll never feel bad anymore`

    title: `I Love Rock 'N Roll`,
    artist: 'Joan Jett & the Blackhearts',
    lyrics: `I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he must 'a been about seventeen
The beat was goin' strong
Playin' my favorite song

An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me, yeah me
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
Till he was with me, yeah me, singin'

I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come an' take your time and dance with me

He smiled so I got up and asked for his name
That don't matter, he said, 'cause it's all the same
I said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
And next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah me
Next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah me, singin'

I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come an' take your time and dance with me

Said, "Can I take you home where we can be alone?"
And next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah me
And we'll be movin' on
And singin' that same old song, yeah with me, singin'

I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come an' take your time and dance with me

I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come an' take your time and dance with me`

    title: `Rockin' in the Free World`,
    artist: 'Neil Young',
    lyrics: `There's colors on the street
Red, white and blue
People shufflin' their feet
People sleepin' in their shoes
But there's a warnin' sign on the road ahead
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead
Don't feel like Satan, but I am to them
So I try to forget it, any way I can

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she puts the kid away, and she's gone to get a hit
She hates her life, and what she's done to it
There's one more kid that'll never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler, machine gun hand
We got department stores and toilet paper
Got Styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people, says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive

Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world`

    title: 'Last Kiss',
    artist: 'Pearl Jam',
    lyrics: `Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screamin' tires, the bustin' glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

When I woke up, the rain was pourin' down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running in my eyes
But I found my baby somehow that night
I raised her head, and when she smiled and said
"Hold me, darling, for a little while"
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I had missed
Well now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night

Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world`

    title: 'Take Me Out',
    artist: 'Franz Ferdinand',
    lyrics: `So if you're lonely
You know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here
You leave me broken, shattered, I lie
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot, then we can die

I know I won't be leaving here with you
I say, don't you know?
You say you don't know
I say, take me out
I say, you don't show
Don't move, time is slow
I say, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, don't you know?
You say you don't know
I say, take me out
If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you to take me out

I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here with you`

    title: 'Yellow',
    artist: 'Coldplay',
    lyrics: `Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called Yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know, for you I'd bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry

It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do`
